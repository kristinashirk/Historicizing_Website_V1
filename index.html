    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The invention of the internet meant that an endless amount of information could be shared world wide. The problem in the early days of the internet was that each piece of information, each page, was a separate silo. For a website to be usable, and more than one long page, designers needed a way for users to jump from one page to another. The introduction of internal links and the href tag meant that separate pages within a site could work together, and outside websites could be linked together. Once it was possible to link pages together, this navigation needed structure to help users weed through the labyrinth of websites in the early 90’s. This digital essay traces the development of website navigation, from div elements with ARIA supplements to the nav element, and its implications on usability and accessibility.</p>

    <h3>Historicizing Technology</h3>
    <p class="caption">Christina Haas presents a sociological perspective on the interaction between old and new technologies in the workplace. She cites the work of sociologists Vygotsky and Bijker as the basis for her claim that <q>overly simple views of technology in the classroom may lead to a silencing of students who resist technology and a flattening of the different effects, both good and ill, that technology can have on individuals and groups</q> (<a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/science/article/pii/S8755461599000031">Haas, 1999, pg. 210</a>). Using three workplace examples of the intersection of new and old technologies, Haas demonstrates that:</p>
        <ul class="caption">
          <li>(a) competing views of old and new technologies exist in workplaces,</li>
          <li>(b) multiple literacy technologies are copresent in the conduct of work, and</li>
          <li>(c) more advanced technologies are not necessarily more powerful technologies. (<a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/science/article/pii/S8755461599000031">Haas, 1999</a>)</li>
      </ul>


<p>Indeed, Haas shows that new technologies do not simply replace old technologies, but rather are in a constant state of evolution. This means that older technologies will coexist with newer technologies in a workplace, much like the coexistence of homo erectus and homo sapiens in the evolution of apes.</p>

<p>The nav element is a perfect example of the coexistence of new and old technologies. The nav element was introduced in HTML 5, giving web designers a designated element to distinguish their navigation elements from other block-level elements in their site. The nav element is also used in accessibility tools like screen readers to distinguish navigation elements from the main page content. Traditionally, navigation elements were simply sequestered in a div element, and designers would use ARIA landmarks to signal the navigation function of the div to accessibility tools. The nav element simplified this process. But both of these practices still exist and are in use today. They are both valid methods of separating out navigation elements for web designers and marking the elements for accessibility purposes. This demonstrates Haas’ point that technology is evolutionary, and that old and new technologies commonly coexist.</p>
