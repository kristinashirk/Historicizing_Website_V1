    <h2>nav Element</h2>
    <p>It is a block level HTML element that is “used to define a block of navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. Examples of navigation blocks are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.”
“It's not necessary for all links to be contained in a nav element. nav is intended only for major block of navigation links; typically the footer element often has a list of links that don't need to be in a nav element.”
“A document may have several nav elements, for example, one for site navigation and one for intra-page navigation. aria-labelledby can be used in such case to promote accessibility, see example.”
“User agents, such as screen readers targeting disabled users, can use this element to determine whether to omit the initial rendering of navigation-only content.”
