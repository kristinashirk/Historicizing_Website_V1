    <h2>Website Navigation</h2>
      <p class="caption"><strong><q>A central theme in web design is the development of a web navigation interface that maximizes usability. A website's overall navigational scheme includes several navigational pieces such as global, local, supplemental, and contextual navigation; all of these are vital aspects of the broad topic of web navigation</q></strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_navigation#Future_of_web_navigation">Web navigation, n.d.</a>).</p>

      <p>Web navigation is difficult because it is so versatile. Every website as a different structure, purpose, and every user has different navigational needs. Designers can bridge the gap between users needs and the design of the website by working to create rich navigational elements, beginning with the nav element. The nav element is helpful to mark the navigational links differently from other links in a website, no matter what navigation structure you use.</p>


      <h3>Elements of Web Navigation</h3>
        <p><strong>Information Architecture</strong>: Website navigation reflects the underlying structure of the website. If the website is constructed properly, the navigation elements will be effective and easy to use. The complexity of the site’s navigation is <q>ultimately determined by the site hierarchy.</q> Ideally, you want to create an information structure with a flat hierarchy containing relatively few layers, to make navigation quicker and <q>provide a clear, simple path to all the web pages from anywhere on the website.</q></p>

      <figure class="caption">

        <figcaption>Figure 3. is an example of a "flat hierarchy." The image shows a hierarchy scheme with only three layers of information. (<a href="https://www.uxbooth.com/articles/the-rules-for-modern-navigation/">Lin, 2018</a>)</figcaption>

        <p><strong>Global Website Navigation</strong>: Global website navigation shows the top level sections/pages of the website. It is available on each page and lists the main content sections/pages of the website. The global navigation elements of your site should reflect the underlying information hierarchy of the site. Global navigation comes in several different styles:
            <ul class="caption">
              <li>Navigation Tabs</li>
              <li>Navigation Bar</li>
              <li>Plain List</li>
              <li>Pull-Down Menu</li>
              <li>Navigation Buttons</li>
              <li>Pop-up (cascading) menus (<a href="http://www.webdesignpractices.com/navigation/globalnav.html">Adkisson, 2005</a>)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

      <h3>Secondary Navigation</h3>
      <p><strong>Site Map</strong>: A site map is a list of pages of a website accessible to crawlers or users. Site maps are typically separate pages within a website that lists all of the pages in a website. They can also be found in the footer of websites.</p>

      <p class="caption">Site maps provide a <q>visual representation of the information space in order to help users understand where they can go</q> (<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/site-map-usability/">Nielsen, 2008</a>). Site maps reflect the underlying information architecture of the site. If a site is designed well, the site map can provide the user a useful overview of the website at a glance.</p>

    <figure class="caption">
      <img src= "Images/SiteMap.png" alt="site map navigation example" style="width:800px;height:250px;">
      <figcaption>Figure 5. is an example of a site map located in the footer of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WGRGUEA?pf_rd_p=c2945051-950f-485c-b4df-15aac5223b10&pf_rd_r=J78D8DQWGKH34KFQ7WFA&th=1">Amazon's website</a>. </figcaption>

      <p class="caption"><strong>Breadcrumbs</strong>: A breadcrumb is a type of secondary navigation scheme that reveals the user’s location in a website or application. Breadcrumbs are usually present in <q>websites that have a large amount of content organized in a hierarchical manner</q> (<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/03/breadcrumbs-in-web-design-examples-and-best-practices/">Gube, 2009</a>). They can also be used as a sort of progress bar for <q>web applications that have more than one step</q> (<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/03/breadcrumbs-in-web-design-examples-and-best-practices/">Gube, 2009</a>).</p>

      <p class="caption">Typically, breadcrumbs are listed horizontally and separated by the “greater than” symbol (>); <q>the symbol indicates the level of that page relative to the page links beside it</q> (<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/03/breadcrumbs-in-web-design-examples-and-best-practices/">Gube, 2009</a>).</p>

      <p>There are many benefits to including breadcrumbs in your sites navigational structure:
        <ul class="caption"></p>
          <li>Breadcrumbs show people their current location relative to higher-level concepts, helping them understand where they are in relation to the rest of the site.</li>
          <li>Breadcrumbs afford one-click access to higher site levels and thus rescue users who parachute into very specific but inappropriate destinations through search or deep links.</li>
          <li>Breadcrumbs never cause problems in user testing: people might overlook this small design element, but they never misinterpret breadcrumb trails or have trouble operating them.</li>
          <li>Breadcrumbs take up very little space on the page. (<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/breadcrumb-navigation-useful/">Nielson, 2007</a>)</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>Benefits of the nav tag</h3>
          <p>It is essential that your navigational elements are separated from your content elements. Using the nav tag to sequester navigational elements ultimately helps both the developer and user.</p>

          <p>The developer benefits from highly structured content that is easy to navigate visually. If navigational elements are contained in a nav tag, the developer knows right away the purpose and function of the content within the element.</p>

          <p>Users benefit from the use of the nav tag with a predictable website structure and accessibility features of the element. Nav elements encourage are a major player in navigation schema standards, and enforce consistent website formatting that makes website navigation intuitive and user friendly.</p>
