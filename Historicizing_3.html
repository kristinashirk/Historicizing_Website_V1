    <h2>Website Navigation</h2>
      <p><q>A central theme in web design is the development of a web navigation interface that maximizes usability. A website's overall navigational scheme includes several navigational pieces such as global, local, supplemental, and contextual navigation; all of these are vital aspects of the broad topic of web navigation.</q></p>

      <p><q>Navigation menus reflect the underlying structure of websites. Application menus provide access to the essential functionality of an application. Thus menus are critical parts of web pages and applications and require particular attention during design and development.</q></p>

      <p>Web navigation is difficult because it is so versatile. Every website as a different structure, purpose, and every user has different navigational needs. Designers can bridge the gap between users needs and the design of the website by working to create rich navigational elements, beginning with the nav tag. The nav tag is super helpful to mark the navigational links differently from other links in a website, no matter what navigation structure you use.</p>


      <h3>Different Types of Web Navigation</h3>
        <p><strong>Hierarchial Navigation</strong>: The structure of the website navigation is built from general to specific. This provides a clear, simple path to all the web pages from anywhere on the website.</p>

        <p><strong>Global Website Navigation</strong>: Global website navigation shows the top level sections/pages of the website. It is available on each page and lists the main content sections/pages of the website.</p>

        <p><strong>Local Website Navigation</strong>: Local navigation is the links within the text of a given web page, linking to other pages within the website.</p>


      <h3>Different Navigation Styles</h3>
        <p><strong>Navigation Bar</strong>: A navigation bar or (navigation system) is a section of a website or online page intended to aid visitors in travelling through the online document.</p>

        <p><strong>Site Map</strong>: A site map (or sitemap) is a list of pages of a web site accessible to crawlers or users. It can be either a document in any form used as a planning tool for Web design, or a Web page that lists the pages on a Web site, typically organized in hierarchical fashion.</p>

        <p><strong>Dropdown Menu</strong>: In computing with graphical user interfaces, a dropdown menu or drop-down menu or drop-down list is a user interface control GUI element ("widget" or "control"), similar to a list box, which allows the user to choose one value from a list.</p>

        <p><strong>Flyout Menu</strong>: In computing with graphical user interfaces, a menu that flies out (either down or to the side) when you click or hover (mouseover) some GUI element.</p>

        <p><strong>Named Anchor</strong>: An anchor element is called an anchor because web designers can use it to anchor a URL to some text on a web page. When users view the web page in a browser, they can click the text to activate the link and visit the page whose URL is in the link.</p>


        <h3>Benefits of the nav tag</h3>
          <p>It is essential that your navigational elements are separated from your content elements. Using the nav tag to sequester navigational elements ultimately helps both the developer and user.</p>

          <p>The developer benefits from highly structured content that is easy to navigate visually. If navigational elements are contained in a nav tag, the developer knows right away the purpose and function of the content within the tag.</p>

          <p>Further, (discuss diligently structured content and the advantages of using the nav tag as well as other block-level tags to visually organize code).</p>

          <p>Users benefit from the use of the nav tag with a predictable website structure and accessibility features of the tag. (discuss how the nav tag benefits users different navigation styles and the overall usability of the site).</p>
