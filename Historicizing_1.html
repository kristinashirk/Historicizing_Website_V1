    <h2>The Future of Website Navigation</h2>
    <p class="caption">The future of web design, and in turn web navigation, is a personalized interactive experience. Designers are now challenged to “create interactive interfaces that are integrative and effective” (Tham, 2018, p. 46). In terms of navigation, how users interact with websites, how they navigate them, and how navigation will change with new technologies.</p>

    <p class="caption">Website navigation is becoming a personal affair, with more and more websites <q>attempting to automatically personalize web sites based on a user’s browsing pattern in order to find relevant information more quickly and efficiently</q> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_navigation#Future_of_web_navigation">Web navigation, n.d.</a>).</p>

    <p class="caption">To understand the goals of interactive web navigation, we can look to Jason Tham’s navigability/accessibility dimension of interactivity for immersive media. Tham uses Casto et al.’s definition of navigability as <q>the efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction with which users navigate the system in order to fulfill their goals under specific conditions</q> (2018, p. 57). Website navigation has a huge effect on the overall user experience of a site. Users need to be able to navigate a website quickly and efficiently if they are going to be return customers. Tham demonstrates effective navigation with interactive content when he states:
    <q>An interactive website employs intuitive text hyperlink structures and elements of navigation that increase overall effectiveness in using the site (e.g. site map, search bar, header and side menus, permanent links across pages, etc.). Specific to immersive media context, navigability is translated to accessibility since products like a smartwatch and home AI have very limited screen navigation</q> (Tham, 2018, p. 57).</p>

    <p class="caption">Today, adaptive website navigation appears in the form of adaptive web recommendation systems (AWR). AWR systems use content-based filtering and collaborative filtering to personalize <q>observed user activity,</q> and provide <q>a list of recommended links ordered by their perceived interest</q> (Brusilovsky, 2004, p. 14). Content-based filtering employs <q>word-level document representation and user profiles inherited from information retrieval research and usually employs some machine learning technologies</q> (Brusilovsky, 2004, p. 15). Collaborative filtering is <q>a social navigation technology</q> that uses <q>recorded information about past usage of the same set of documents by multiple users</q> (Brusilovsky, 2004, p. 16). Collaborative filtering then <q>applies various profile matching algorithms to match users with similar interests</q> (Brusilovsky, 2004, p. 15). Together, content-based filtering and collaborative filtering use user activity information to adapt navigation recommendations to a user’s interest.</p>

    <p>AWR systems have their limitations in providing truly adaptive and useful navigation as they only offer one-dimensional personalization based on user activity.</p>

    <p class="caption">Peter Brusilovsky, a researcher at the University of Pittsburgh, sees the future of web navigation as a system that can <q>adapt the presentation of links located on a hypertext page (hypernode) to the goals, knowledge, and preferences of the individual user</q> (Brusilovsky, 2004, p. 8). This adaptive hypermedia (AH) approach to web navigation will provide a rich navigation recommendations the system <q>adapts to various “aspects” of the user (goals, knowledge, interests, browsing history) and apply a rich set of adaptive navigation support techniques to express several aspects important to the users at the same time (such as goal relevance, novelty, readiness, etc.)</q> (Brusilovsky, 2004, p. 15).</p>

    <p class="caption">Current AH technologies <q>are only applicable within a relatively small set of documents that were structured and enhanced by metadata annotations at design time</q> (Brusilovsky, 2004, p. 15). No one has been able to successfully adapt AH systems to an open corpus environment like the internet. Brusilovsky explains that, <q>closed corpus AH systems demonstrate what is possible to achieve with adaptive hypermedia, but they are impractical for most real world applications. No one is able to invest enough time to structure and index thousands of documents collected from all over the Web so that the result satisfies the requirements of modern adaptive hypermedia systems</q> (2004, p. 14).</p>
