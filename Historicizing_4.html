    <h2>Web Accessibility</h2>
      <p class="caption"><strong><q>The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, culture, location, or physical or mental ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability</q></strong> (<a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility">Accessibility, 2018</a>).</p>

      <p class="caption">Central to accessible websites are a solid information structure and rich navigation elements. Navigation elements allow users using screen readers to <q>choose whatever way of finding pages is easiest for them. Users with low vision may find using search easier than navigating through a large menu. Users with cognitive impairments may prefer a table of contents or site map over clicking through many pages</q> (<a href="https://usability.yale.edu/web-accessibility/articles/navigation">Navigation, 2018</a>). Web accessibility began as an afterthought to web design. It was an optional add-on by charitable designers. Today, however, web accessibility is a crucial aspect of web design. The following discusses the evolution of accessible web navigation and the implications of the nav element in modern web design.</p>

      <h3>ARIA and Accessibility</h3>
        <p class="caption">A precursor to HTML5 and the nav element was ARIA. ARIA, or Accessible Rich Internet Applications, <q>is a set of attributes that define ways to make Web content and Web applications more accessible to people with disabilities</q> (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA">ARIA, 2018</a>).<p>

        <p class="caption">ARIA supplements HTML so that interactions and widgets commonly used in applications can be interpreted by accessible technologies. For example, <q>ARIA enables accessible navigation landmarks in HTML4, JavaScript widgets, form hints and error messages, live content updates, and more</q> (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA">ARIA, 2018</a>).</p>

        <p class="caption">Navigation in ARIA is defined by navigation landmark roles. The ARIA navigation role works much like the modern nav element, by providing <q>a way to identify the organization and structure of a web page</q> (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Navigation_Role">ARIA: Navigation Role, 2018</a>). By using the navigation roles to classify and label sections of a page, <q>structural information is conveyed visually through layout and is represented programmatically</q> (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Navigation_Role">ARIA: Navigation Role, 2018</a>). These structural cues allow screen readers to <q>provide keyboard navigation to important sections of a page</q> (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Navigation_Role">ARIA: Navigation Role, 2018</a>).</p>

        <figcaption>Figure 7. is an example of ARIA elements in HTML code. ARIA is supplemental code to indicate navigational elements. This example code is from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/An_overview_of_accessible_web_applications_and_widgets">Mozilla's ARIA development guide.</a></figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Nav and Accessibility</h3>
        <p>However, many of the supplemental mechanics of ARIA were incorporated into HTML5, including the nav element.</p>

        <p class="caption">As mentioned above, the nav element works in much the same way as ARIA navigation roles - it marks content contained within the tag as navigational elements. <q>Browsers, such as screen readers for disabled users, can use the nav tag to determine whether to omit the initial rendering of this content</q> (<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_nav.asp">HTML nav tag, 2018</a>).</p>

        <p class= "caption">The nav element has the advantage over using ARIA supplemental roles in that <q>using the nav element will automatically communicate a section has a role of navigation</q> (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Navigation_Role">ARIA: Navigation Role, 2018</a>). The labeling benefits of ARIA navigation roles are embedded in the nav element.</p>

        <p class="caption">It is advised by accessibility experts that developers use the HTML element over using ARIA attributes (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Navigation_Role">ARIA: Navigation Role, 2018</a>).</p>

    <h3>Ways to improve your site’s navigation for accessibility:</h3>
      <p class="caption">Stephanie Lin of the UXBooth presents the following rules for creating effective, accessible website navigation in her article <q><a href= "https://www.uxbooth.com/articles/the-rules-for-modern-navigation/">The Rules for Modern Navigation</a></q>:</p>
        <p><strong>Prioritize consistency</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Consistently employ navigational elements throughout your site. For example, if your main navigation bar includes dropdown menus displaying subpage links, each element in the main bar should have a dropdown menu.</li>
            <li>Use secondary navigational elements consistently throughout the site. This reinforces your site’s information hierarchy and helps the user easily navigate from one page to another.</li>
            <li>Ensure all navigational elements function and link to a landing page.</li>
            <li>Visual design should clearly indicate the function of a navigational element, and whether that element is a link or simply a design element.</li>
            <li>Use clear language in your link descriptions so users know exactly where the link leads to. This is especially important for users who rely on screen readers.</li>
          </ul>
        <p><strong>Design clear interactions</p></strong>
          <ul>
            <li><q>When a site visitor doesn’t know which items are interactive, or what interactions to expect, confusion results. Combat this confusion by thoughtfully designing interactions to be clear and understandable.</q></li>
            <li>Use visual change to indicate interactions. The change clearly shows users when an element has been used, or if it is an interactive element.</li>
            <li>Use labels. Labels clearly indicate the function of an element and reduce ambiguity. Labels are especially important to users using screen readers and other accessibility tools.</li>
          </ul>
        <p><strong>Avoid deep navigation</p></strong>
          <ul>
            <li><q>Strive for a “flat navigation,” where the user can access the deepest nested page in the site within one to two clicks.</q> This may require you to reconstruct your site's hierarchy, reclassify and consolidate information, or remove content to reduce the complexity of your site.</li>
            <li>Use short menus. Short menus reduce the congnitive load for users and make it easier for them to locate the information they need.</li>
            <li>Visually design your menu to mimic the information hierarchy of your site. Use font size, color, and weights to indicate the underlying structure. This will allow users to quickly understand <q>which links are primary, secondary, and tertiary navigation items.</q></li>
            <li>Use location indicators, like breadcrumbs, to show users where they are within your site.</li>
          </ul>
        <p><strong>Design for responsive compatibility</p></strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Remove hover interactions in your main navigation elements to avoid confusion for users, make screen reader navigation easier, and make your site easily adaptable to mobile.</li>
            <li>Use different navigation for mobile and desktop. Optimizing navigation for each device will make the overall user experience of your site much better.</li>
          </ul>
    <h3>Supplemental guidelines for accessibile content</h3>
    <p>Below I have included Media Genesis's guide for creating accessible web content. This guide goes beyond accessible navigation and provides a nice overview for creating an accessible website.</p>
